### About
I created this small program in order to simulate the statistical outcome of the Monty Hall Problem. I can't fully wrap my head around the math surrounding the Monty Hall Problem, and in fact disagreed with the accepted solution, so I created this program in an attempt to prove the accepted solution to the problem wrong. Ironically, my own program proved myself wrong and proved the accepted solution to be true, leaving me no choice but to accept as truth that which I do not understand.
